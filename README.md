### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

<!--
**pseudocc/pseudocc** is a âœ¨ _special_ âœ¨ repository because its `README.md` (this file) appears on your GitHub profile.

Here are some ideas to get you started:

- ðŸ”­ Iâ€™m currently working on ...
- ðŸŒ± Iâ€™m currently learning ...
- ðŸ‘¯ Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on ...
- ðŸ¤” Iâ€™m looking for help with ...
- ðŸ’¬ Ask me about ...
- ðŸ“« How to reach me: ...
- ðŸ˜„ Pronouns: ...
- âš¡ Fun fact: ...
-->

ðŸ¤” I want to create my own programming language "pseudoc", and that's how my user
name comes from (github do not allow me to name myself "pseudoc").

ðŸ˜„ I am a big fan of the "Rick & Morty" sitcon and enjoy being the rickest geek.
I like to learn things from real world applications, dive deeply into the essence,
build my own stuffs from scratch. I treasure self-improvement and feel content
during the process.

My favorite programming languages are C and javascript, I am currently learning
Rust by creating a board game (CLI, HTML+Wasm).
