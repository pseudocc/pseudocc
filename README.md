I wanted to create my own programming language "pseudoc", and that's how my user
name came from (github do not allow me to name myself "pseudoc").

I am a big fan of the "Rick & Morty" sitcon and enjoy being the rickest geek.
I like to learn things from real world applications, dive deeply into the essence,
build my own stuffs from scratch. I treasure self-improvement and feel content
during the process.

I am the one that chooses the way to be different, living a normal life is dull,
I use a custom keyboard (PCB designed by [Ben Vallack](github.com/benvallack/)).

My favorite programming languages used to be C and javascript, now zig is the new
king!
